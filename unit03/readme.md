#Walkthrough

- [x] Create a new project called Loops. Then compile and test the WhileLoopDemo below. 
- [x] Notice the == operator that’s used to compare the values of SEng variables.
Note the program prints only those elements that are not null. The operator continue changes the execuEon flow and goes back to check the while expression. 
- [x] Change the code to exit the loop as soon as the program finds and prints the name Matilda. Use the break keyword for this.

#Homework 
- [x] Study the lessons 5 and 6 from the textbook and do the assignment from the Try It secEons of these lessons. 
  - [x] p.117. Introduce command-line arguments into the program from Listing 4-6. 
  - [x] p.134. create a simple program that will increase pay, which is implemented differently for employees and contractors. After completing this assignment
you’ll have working but not perfect code. 
- [ ] Find put the difference between ++i and i++
- [ ] Read about immutable nature of String objects in Java. Learn the difference between creaEon of strings with “” vs. new operator. Will both if-statement below evaluate to true? Use Eclipse debugger to find out.
``` 
String gfriend=“Masha”;
if (gfriend==“Masha”){ // true or false?}
String gfriend1 = new String (“Natasha”);
String gfriend2 = new String (“Natasha”);
if (gfriend1==gfriend2){ // true or false?}
```
- [ ] Study various types of Java for and while loops. 
- [ ] Modify the program HelloWorld to process one command-line argument to 
print hello with the name that was passed in the command line. For example, 
if you’ll start this program as 
java HelloWorld Mary 
it’ll print “Hello Mary” 
- [ ] Complete the assignments from the Try it secEon from Lesson 5.
