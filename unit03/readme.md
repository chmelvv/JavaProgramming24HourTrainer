#Walkthrough
1.	Create	a	new	project	called	Loops.	Then		compile	and	test	the	WhileLoopDemo	below.	
2.	NoEce	the	==	operator	that’s	used	to compare	the	values	of	SEng	variables.
Note	the	program	prints	only	those		 elements	that	are	not	null.		The	operator	 continue	changes	the	execuEon	flow	and		 goes	back	to	check	the	while	expression.	
3.	Change	the	code	to	exit	the	loop	as		 soon	as	the	program	finds	and	prints	the	name		 MaElda.	Use	the	break	keyword	for	this.

#Homework	
1.	Study	the	lessons	5	and	6	from	the	textbook	and	do	the	assignment	from	the	 Try	It	secEons	of	these	lessons.	
2.	Find	put	the	difference	between	++i and	i++
3.	Read	about	immutable	nature	of	String	objects	in	Java.	Learn	the	difference	 between	creaEon	of	strings	with	“”	vs.	new	operator.		Will	both	if-statement	 below	evaluate	to	true?	Use	Eclipse	debugger	to	find	out.
	
String gfriend=“Masha”;
if (gfriend==“Masha”){ // true or false?}
String gfriend1 = new String (“Natasha”);
String gfriend2 = new String (“Natasha”);
if (gfriend1==gfriend2){ // true or false?}

5.	Study	various	types	of	Java	for	and	while	loops.	
6.	Modify	the	program	HelloWorld	to	process	one	command-line	argument	to	
print	hello	with	the	name	that	was	passed	in	the	command	line.	For	example,	
if	you’ll	start	this	program	as		
java	HelloWorld	Mary	
it’ll	print	“Hello	Mary”		
7.	Complete	the	assignments	from	the	Try	it	secEon	from	Lesson	5.
