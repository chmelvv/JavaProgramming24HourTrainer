#Walkthrough
1.	Create	a	new	project	called	Loops.	Then		compile	and	test	the	WhileLoopDemo	below.	
2.	NoEce	the	==	operator	that’s	used	to compare	the	values	of	SEng	variables.

Note	the	program	prints	only	those		 elements	that	are	not	null.		The	operator	 continue	changes	the	execuEon	flow	and		 goes	back	to	check	the	while	expression.	

3.	Change	the	code	to	exit	the	loop	as		 soon	as	the	program	finds	and	prints	the	name		 MaElda.	Use	the	break	keyword	for	this.
